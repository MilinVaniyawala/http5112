A repo that stores files and folders regarding **HTTP 5112**. However, here HTTP 5112 stands for Web Development Lab. Which is divided into two parts. In the first part, we learn about Database, and in the remaining one, we learn about C#.

#### Sample Select Database Query

```sql
SELECT * FROM tablename;
```

> :memo: **Note:** The SELECT command is used to select data from a database. The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result set.

#### Sample Code of C#

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
  }
}
```

> :memo: **Note:** above we created a C# file called Program.cs, and we used the following code to print "Hello World" to the screen.
